Server side rendered app using express, ejs templating language, and session based authentication. This app focuses on the back-end and has minimal styling. People can write anonymous messages to be displayed for everyone to see. They can decide to sign up and login or stay logged out. If they sign up and become a member, then they can see who posted the messages. Admins have the same privileges as members plus they can delete messages.
